IP Calculator
Created by Ahmet Azizov 🧮.

A console application written in IntelliJ IDEA using JAVA ☕.

The main motivation for creating this project was me wanting to complete the tasks given by my network 
class professor using a computer program, and leverage my jAVA skills along the way 👨🏼‍💻.

This is a simple calculator which calculates the range, subnet mask, network address, and other 
parameters of the entered network in IPv4 format depending on its user size .

For now, this project can be tested by running the source file using IntelliJ IDEA or a similar IDE 💻.

Note: I might update this project as I find new bugs or want to implement new features 🔧.
