IP Calculator
Created by Ahmet Azizov.

A console application written in IntelliJ IDEA using JAVA. 

The main motivation for creating this project was me wanting to complete the tasks given by my network 
class professor using a computer program, and leverage my jAVA skills along the way.

This is a simple calculator which calculates the range, subnet mask, network address, and other 
parameters of the entered network depending on its user size.

For now, this project can be tested by running the source file using IntelliJ IDEA or a similar IDE.

Note: I might update this project as I find new bugs or want to implement new features.
